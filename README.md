# Sylphus - Online Open Source Code Editor

Welcome to the Sylphus organization! We are dedicated to developing an advanced online open source code editor that empowers developers to code, collaborate, and deploy seamlessly. Our code editor, designed with GitHub API integration, enables you to edit GitHub repositories online and even self-host your own instance.

## About Sylphus

Sylphus is an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing the way developers interact with code editing and collaboration. Our open source code editor comes with a range of features tailored to enhance your coding experience:

- **GitHub API Integration**: Connect your GitHub repositories directly to our code editor, allowing you to edit code files, commit changes, and manage branches without leaving the platform.

- **Online Code Editing**: Edit your code files in real-time using our user-friendly web interface. Benefit from syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and code suggestions for various programming languages.

- **Collaboration**: Collaborate seamlessly by creating pull requests, reviewing code changes, and merging branches directly within the editor.

- **Netlify Integration**: Deploy your projects to Netlify with ease from within the editor, making it simple to showcase your work to the world.
